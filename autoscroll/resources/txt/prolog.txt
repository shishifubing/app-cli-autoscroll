Enables universal autoscroll.

Pretty pointless since on Linux you can achieve it using config files and for Windows there are usually drivers.

Supports only mouse buttons.

You can pass file contents as arguments using '@path' syntax, every argument in that case should begin on the new line.

If you want to dynamically pass arguments without restarting the process you can use '--config' options for it.

Once you press '--buttons-start', you can scroll vertically or horizontally just by moving your mouse untill you press '--buttons-end'.

If '--buttons-hold' is set, the srolling ends once you release '--buttons-start'.

You can change arguments on runtime by enabling a config file, you can do so by setting '--config-enable' and '--config-path'.

By default, an icon is shown once the scrolling starts, you can disable it by setting '--icon-disable'.

Once '--buttons-start' is pressed, the scroll thread starts looping. Every loop consists of sleeping for an interval, then scrolling for either 0, 1, or -1 pixels on both axis towards the starting point.
Starting point is the point where '--buttons-start' was pressed.
Sleep interval is recalculated on every mouse move as such:
    100 / ('--scrolling-acceleration' * max(distance) + '--scrolling-speed')
If '--scrolling-acceleration' is not 0, the speed of scrolling will be faster
the farther away you are from the starting point.
If '--scrolling-acceleration' is 0, the speed of the scrolling will be constant.
